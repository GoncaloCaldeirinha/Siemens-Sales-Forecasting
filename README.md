# Siemens Sales Forecasting Case Study
Master's project for the Business Cases with Data Science course

### Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of a sales forecasting case study challenge presented by Siemens Advanta Consulting to NOVA IMS. The challenge involves creating a monthly sales forecast using real sales data from a Siemens business unit in Germany.

### Business Situation
#### Case Context
Accurate sales forecasting is critical for business operations. Traditional manual forecasting methods are resource-intensive and often biased, leading to significant opportunity costs. An AI-driven approach can mitigate these issues by leveraging historical data and macroeconomic indicators to provide more accurate and efficient forecasts.

The challenge focuses on selected product groups within the Smart Infrastructure Division of Siemens, specifically targeting the largest market (Germany). The objective is to forecast monthly sales using historical sales data and relevant macroeconomic indices.

### Assignment
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the datasets to understand the structure and identify relevant features.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Develop features that capture the underlying trends and patterns in the sales data and macroeconomic indices.
3. **Model Development:** Use machine learning techniques to develop a sales forecasting model.
5. **Model Evaluation:**  Using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on the test set (May 2022 to February 2023).
